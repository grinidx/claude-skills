# Outlook Email & Calendar Integration

Access Microsoft 365 Outlook email and calendar from Claude Code via Microsoft Graph API.

## Features

**Email:**
- List inbox, unread, filtered by sender
- Search emails
- Read full message content
- Create drafts in Outlook (plain text or markdown-formatted)
- Send emails (with confirmation)
- Download and attach files (up to 150MB)
- Archive, delete, mark read/unread

**Calendar:**
- View today's events, week view, upcoming
- Check availability (free/busy)
- Create events (with confirmation)
- Update and delete events

## Quick Start

### 1. Install Dependencies

```bash
# macOS
brew install azure-cli jq curl pandoc

# Ubuntu/Debian
sudo apt install azure-cli jq curl pandoc

# Or install Azure CLI: https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/cli/azure/install-azure-cli
```

**Note:** `pandoc` is optional - only needed for markdown-formatted emails (`mddraft` command).

### 2. Install the Skill

From the repo root:

```bash
./install.sh outlook
```

Or manually:

```bash
mkdir -p ~/.claude/skills/outlook
cp -r outlook/* ~/.claude/skills/outlook/
chmod +x ~/.claude/skills/outlook/scripts/*.sh
```

### 3. Run Setup

```bash
~/.claude/skills/outlook/scripts/outlook-setup.sh
```

This will:
1. Log you into Azure
2. Create an app registration with required permissions
3. Open browser for M365 consent
4. Store credentials securely in `~/.outlook/`
5. Test the connection

### 4. Verify

```bash
~/.claude/skills/outlook/scripts/outlook-token.sh test
```

Should show:
```
Connection successful!
Inbox: X total, Y unread
```

```bash
# View events
~/.claude/skills/outlook/scripts/outlook-calendar.sh events [count]
~/.claude/skills/outlook/scripts/outlook-calendar.sh today
~/.claude/skills/outlook/scripts/outlook-calendar.sh week

# Read event details
~/.claude/skills/outlook/scripts/outlook-calendar.sh read <event-id>

~/.claude/skills/outlook/scripts/outlook-calendar.sh calendars

# Delete event
~/.claude/skills/outlook/scripts/outlook-calendar.sh delete <event-id>
```

### Multiple Accounts

Each account stores credentials under `~/.outlook/<account>/`. The active account is selected by (in order of precedence): `--account <name>` / `-a <name>` flag, the `OUTLOOK_ACCOUNT` env var, then `default`.

```bash
# Default account
~/.claude/skills/outlook/scripts/outlook-mail.sh inbox

# Named account (flag)
~/.claude/skills/outlook/scripts/outlook-mail.sh -a work inbox

# Named account (env var)
OUTLOOK_ACCOUNT=work ~/.claude/skills/outlook/scripts/outlook-mail.sh inbox

# List configured accounts
~/.claude/skills/outlook/scripts/outlook-token.sh list

# Add a new account (reuses existing Azure app registration if one is already configured)
~/.claude/skills/outlook/scripts/outlook-setup.sh --account work
```

An existing single-account install at `~/.outlook/{config,credentials,id_cache}.json` is auto-migrated to `~/.outlook/default/` on the first run of any script — no manual action needed.

**Calendar timezone** is auto-detected from the system (`/etc/timezone`, `timedatectl`, or `/etc/localtime`). Override per-run with the `OUTLOOK_TZ` env var:

```bash
OUTLOOK_TZ=America/New_York ~/.claude/skills/outlook/scripts/outlook-calendar.sh today
```

### Token Management

```bash
# Test connection
~/.claude/skills/outlook/scripts/outlook-token.sh test

# Refresh expired token
~/.claude/skills/outlook/scripts/outlook-token.sh refresh

# Check status
~/.claude/skills/outlook/scripts/outlook-token.sh status

# Get raw token (for debugging)
~/.claude/skills/outlook/scripts/outlook-token.sh get
```

## Natural Language (via Claude)

Once installed, you can use natural language:

| You say | What happens |
|---------|--------------|
| "check email" | Lists recent inbox |
| "show unread" | Lists unread emails |
| "emails from John" | Filters by sender |
| "search email for invoice" | Searches content |
| "capture email 3" | Saves to brain's inbox/ |
| "draft email to X about Y" | Creates Outlook draft |
| "draft formatted email to X" | Creates markdown-formatted draft |
| "reply to that saying Z" | Creates reply draft |
| "send it" | Sends after confirmation |
| "what's on today" | Shows today's calendar |
| "my week" | Shows week view |
| "am I free Thursday 2pm" | Checks availability |
| "schedule call with X Tuesday 3pm" | Creates event (with confirm) |

├── config.json                 # Azure app ID + secret
└── credentials.json            # OAuth tokens
```

## Permissions

The Azure app requires these Microsoft Graph delegated permissions:

| Permission | Purpose |
|------------|---------|
| Mail.ReadWrite | Read inbox, manage drafts |
| Mail.Send | Send emails |
| Calendars.ReadWrite | Read/create events |
| offline_access | Refresh tokens without re-login |
| User.Read | Basic profile info |

## Token Expiry

- **Access tokens** expire after ~1 hour but are **automatically refreshed**
- **Refresh tokens** last ~90 days with activity
- No manual intervention needed for token refresh
- If refresh token expires, re-run setup

## Troubleshooting

### "Refresh token expired" / "Invalid grant"
Re-run setup:
```bash
~/.claude/skills/outlook/scripts/outlook-setup.sh
```

### "Insufficient privileges"
1. Go to Azure Portal → App registrations → Your app → API permissions
2. Verify all permissions are listed
3. Remove and re-add if needed
4. Re-run setup to re-consent

### "Message not found"
- Message IDs are the last 20 characters of full IDs
- IDs from `inbox` command work with `read`, `reply`, etc.
- Scripts search recent 100 messages when looking up short IDs

### Connection issues
```bash
# Check status
~/.claude/skills/outlook/scripts/outlook-token.sh status

# Test connection
~/.claude/skills/outlook/scripts/outlook-token.sh test
```

## Manual Setup

If automated setup fails, see `references/setup.md` for step-by-step Azure Portal instructions.

## Security Notes

- Credentials stored with 600 permissions (owner read/write only)
- Client secret valid for 2 years (configurable in Azure)
- Never commit `~/.outlook/` to version control
- Revoke app access: Azure Portal → Enterprise applications → Your app → Delete

## Uninstall

```bash
# Remove skill
rm -rf ~/.claude/skills/outlook

# Remove credentials
rm -rf ~/.outlook-mcp

# Optionally delete Azure app registration
az ad app delete --id <your-app-id>
```
